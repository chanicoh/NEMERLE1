i  built a compiler for the Nemerle programming language as part of the course project. Here's a brief description of the project:

Project Description: Compiler for Nemerle Language

The project involved the development of a compiler for the Nemerle programming language within the context of the course on programming language principles and paradigms. Nemerle is known for its flexibility and support for various programming paradigms, including imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming.

Key Components and Achievements:

Lexical and Syntactic Analysis: Your compiler likely implemented a lexical analyzer to tokenize the source code and a parser to perform syntactic analysis, ensuring that the code follows the grammar rules of the Nemerle language.

Semantic Analysis: The compiler likely included components for semantic analysis, checking variable scopes, type compatibility, and other aspects that contribute to the correct interpretation of the code.

Code Generation: The project involved the generation of intermediate code or assembly code from the parsed and analyzed Nemerle source code. This phase is crucial for translating the high-level code into executable machine code.

Error Handling: A robust compiler includes effective error-handling mechanisms to provide meaningful feedback to the user about syntax or semantic errors in their code.

Challenges and Learning Opportunities:
Building a compiler is a challenging yet rewarding task that provides in-depth insights into the inner workings of programming languages. The project  gain practical experience in implementing various compiler phases, understanding language design principles, and applying theoretical concepts from the course.

This project not only demonstrates the proficiency in understanding and applying programming language concepts but also showcases the ability to tackle complex tasks in software development.
